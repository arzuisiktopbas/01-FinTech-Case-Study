Robinhood’s story began in April 2013 at Stanford, where [Baiju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiju_Bhatt) and [Vlad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev) met as roommates and classmates. After gradution they built two finance companies in Newyork, they noticed that Wall Street firms charged commission for every trade to Americans, while companies did not pay effectively to trade stocks. They decided to build products that would be encourage everyone to access the financial markets, not just the rich ones.[1](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-story/)
Robinhood has raised a total of **$2.2B** in [funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood) over 18 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Sep 22, 2020 from a Series G round.

## Business Activity

The company tries to match buyers and sellers in security trading at no transaction cost even when they want to trade small amounts. The main problem before Robinhood was buyers/sellers who want to trade small quantities were facing either too high transaction costs or were not able to trade at all.
Robinhood -like as the lagendary hero- takes from the rich to give to the poor, unlike the traditional business model. 

Robinhood use the strategy of "simplicity" and "free" which are lured the millenial and Z population mostly.Their app is free, easy to use and addictive,and charging zero commissions,transfer fees and foreign transaction fees appeals to extremely cost-conscious investors who trade small quantities. 

According to [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40437888/how-brokerage-app-robinhood-got-millennials-to-love-the-market), Robinhood is the most popular sevices platform among the millenial and Z population. Besides older generations' investment approach, Robinhood's users,average age of users is 31, want to both build their savings and develop relationships with brands.

In our rapid-changing world, it is difficult to sustain an unfair advantage. For instance, Robinhoods’ unique selling point was “simplicity and free”. They took great benefit of this for a while, but to compete with Robinhood some competitors reduced most of their commissions to zero  such as E-Trade and Charles Schwab.Just as the [“Mad Money”](https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/) host said “invent ... disrupt ... or die,”.It is considered that the result of [“creative disruption”](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/4JAixE16uoFQfttEnVYSOb/what-is-creative-destruction/) by Robinhood, TD Ameritrade acquisition of Charles Schwab for $26 billion and Morgan Stanley’s $13 billion acquisition of E-Trade. 
Nowadays, Robinhood allows trading cryptocurrency at small amounts,-other cryptocurrency platforms require certain minimums in order to trade.

### Main Technical Tools

The most important impacts of Robinhood-style trade are zero-commission and cryptocurrency trades in small quantities. Robinhood’s commission-[free trading](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/08/19/the-inside-story-of-robinhoods-billionaire-founders-option-kid-cowboys-and-the-wall-street-sharks-that-feed-on-them/#7bd95054268d) is now standard at firms including TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard and Merrill Lynch.

## Recommendations 

So far, we know that Robinhood gets the job done well, especially for new investors. And simplicity and $0 commission trades are the key advantages of using Robinhood over the competition in the market.

In our rapidly changing world, $0 commission trades are now available everywhere and hence investors prefer products offering secure and speedy trades. In this regard, Robinhood should set up their own **[trading desk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingdesk.asp)** where transactions for buying and selling securities occur. This is crucial to enhance market liquidity. I believe that creating a trading desk would attract more individual traders and some large institutional traders. This would be facilitating trade executions and provide greater liquidity at a better price. Moreover, it provides support to agreements between investors and organization and provides a deeper analysis of client’s behavior and characteristics. With trading desk, customers can better understand the market behavior and the fluctuations in the market structure.[1](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/trading-desk/)

In their trading desk, Robinhood could use some of its existing techs. For instance, Python and Go could be used to establish a secure infrastructure for the trading desk and then integrate it into the existing Robinhood matching platform. Slack and G-Suite could be used to ensure collaboration and also Zoom would be a good addition to them. Google Analytics and Retrofit could be used for client management and analyze their trading data at different frequencies. On top of these, Robinhood would need to adopt different technologies to provide customers with up-to-date market news. FactSet and S&P Global Market Intelligence are two good alternatives. Other examples for potential new techs would be FlywayDB and Liquibase for Database Management,  SonarQube and BlackDuck for Code Quality etc.

Many of these techs are very reliable and already used by Robinhood. Hence, the company has already good expertise. This would save both time and money. The potential new techs should need to be adopted are used by the market leaders including BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity. This would increase the reliability of the trading desk at least in terms of security.
